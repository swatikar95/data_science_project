Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore survival rates and patterns among different passenger groups. Using various data visualization and machine learning techniques, we aim to predict survival outcomes based on passenger characteristics.

Features

- Data Plotting: Visualize different aspects of the data to understand underlying patterns.
- Machine Learning: Employ machine learning models to predict survival rates.
- Overfitting Example: Demonstrate overfitting in model training and discuss its implications.
- Overfitting Resolution: Implement strategies to mitigate overfitting and improve model generalizability.
  
Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Libraries: matplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn, sklearn
